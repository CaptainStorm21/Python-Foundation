# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

# Simple Loop
# people = ['John', 'Mary', 'Anna', 'Margaret', 'Sylvia']
# for person in people:
#     print('Current person is: ', person)
    
# Break
# people1 = ['John', 'Mary', 'Anna', 'Margaret', 'Sylvia', 'Monique']
# for child in people1:
#     if child == 'Anna':
#         print('Current child is: ', child)
#         break

# gamers = ['John', 'Mary', 'Anna', 'Margaret', 'Sylvia', 'Monique']
# for person in gamers:
#     if person == 'Caty':
#         continue
#     print('Current gamer is: ', person)
    
# Range 
# gamers = ['John', 'Mary', 'Anna', 'Margaret', 'Sylvia', 'Monique']
# for i in range (len(gamers)):
#     print('Current gamer: ', gamers[i])

# for i in range (0, 10):
#     print ('Number ', i)


# While loops execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
