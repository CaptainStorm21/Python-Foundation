# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

people = ['John', 'Mary', 'Anna', 'Margaret', 'Sylvia']
for person in people:
    print('Current person is:')

# While loops execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
